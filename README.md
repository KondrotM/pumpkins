# pumpkins
A multi-iteration showcase of an HTML website implementing pumpkin-tracking technology. This is satire and there is no real product.


## To run javascript locally
Some parts of the websites implement javascript packages, which cannot be accessed directly from just opening the .html file.

Run the file on a local server instead:
`npm install http-server -g`
`cd ./pumpkins`
`http-server`

The navigate to localhost:8080 in a browser.
